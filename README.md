1. Explanation API

    This is a simple FastAPI microservice that provides simplified explanations for technical concepts tailored to a specific audience (like a School students , etc.). It simulates how a Large Language Model (LLM) might generate explanations in real-time.

3. Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- How to build a RESTful API using FastAPI.
- Using *Pydantic* for request/response validation.
- Simulating an asynchronous LLM (Large Language Model) interaction.
- Using best practices like health check endpoints and clean JSON responses.

3. Technologies Used
    - Python 3.12
- FastAPI – Web framework for building APIs quickly.
- Uvicorn – ASGI server used to run FastAPI apps.
- Pydantic – For data validation and settings management.
- asyncio – Built-in Python module for async support.

4. Widely used commands
- pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic –> Installs the required libraries to build and run your FastAPI app with data validation and an async server.
- pip show fastapi – Displays details about the installed FastAPI package (like version, location, dependencies).
- pip show uvicorn – Shows metadata for Uvicorn, the ASGI server used to run the FastAPI app.
- pip show pydantic – Reveals information about Pydantic, which validates and structures the data models in your API.
- uvicorn main:app --reload – Runs your FastAPI app using Uvicorn, with auto-reload enabled for development changes.

5. API Endpoints
   This endpoint accepts a concept and an audience, and returns a simplified explanation.

 # Request Body


{
  "concept": "vector database",
  "audience": "School Student"
}
  # Response Body
{
  "concept": "vector database",
  "audience": "School Student",
  "explanation": "Okay, imagine explaining 'vector database' to a 'School Student'. It's basically a simplified version of a complex topic meant for easier understanding."
}

. GET /health
 # Used to check if the API is running correctly.
Response
